This is just a quick list that I have come up with, curious to see whether this could be possible/ how much such a project could cost

- Be able to differentiate fresh wallets (newly funded wallets) using the advanced eth filter
- Bot that is able to snipe contracts created created through newly funded wallets, be able to differentiate the newly funded wallets using the eth transfer filter already made and further filter out wallets through filtering fresh wallets. Preferably then snipe these contracts created by these freshly funded wallets through a bot called banana gun or maestro automatically. 
- Automatic limit orders on maestro after a certain “targeted” wallet buys, however, only buy if the targeted wallet still holds the coin (must be sub 100k mcap)
- Add the ability to give followed/watched address a name
- Be able to add a database of up to 50 wallets, and when performing a buy on a newly launched coin (>3 mins old) perform a maestro buy transaction for a specified amount of eth.
